An encrypting and decrypting program. It supports following ciphers:
* Morse code
* Caesar cipher
* Affine cipher
* URL code

The text can be opened from a file or typed directly into the console, after choosing option in the menu, the file will be saved with a name given by the user.
Found issues:
